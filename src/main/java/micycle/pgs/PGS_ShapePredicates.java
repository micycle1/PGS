	 * segments, creating overlapping or self-crossing areas.

	 * dangling edges, disconnected components, or invalid ring configurations in
	 * polygons.
	 * <li>Degenerate geometry: The shape has collapsed or degenerate components,
	 * such as zero-length lines, zero-area polygons, or overlapping vertices.
