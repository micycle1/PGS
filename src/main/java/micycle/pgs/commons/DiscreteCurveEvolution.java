/**
 * This class simplifies curves while maintaining perceptual appearance. It does
 * this through the iterative removal of the least shape-relevant "kinks", which
 * are where consecutive line segments meet (at a vertex).
 * <p>
 * The shape relevance of a kink is calculated based on its turn angle and the
 * lengths of the line segments it comprises. Kinks with larger turn angles and
 * longer segments contribute more to the overall shape of the curve and are
 * thus more likely to be preserved during the simplification process.
 * <p>
 * This class uses an efficient implementation that reduces the time complexity
 * from a naive O(n<sup>2</sup>) to O(n log n), making it suitable for
 * processing large datasets. It handles both closed and open curves. The
 * algorithm is not guaranteed to be topology-preserving.
